**Drivers and Restraints:**

**High Adoption of Combination Vaccines to Boost Market Progress**

Traditional recombinant vaccines are produced in yeast or bacterial cells using a DNA fragment that has been removed from the bacterium or virus and introduced into the manufacturing cells.

Recombinant DNA technology has the advantage of producing an ideal immune response against hepatitis B and is cost-effective when produced utilizing yeast-based recombinant proteins, with improved product safety. However, adults receive reduced seroprotection from standard single-antigen vaccinations, which only work against all known subtypes of HBV.

**North America to Lead Backed by Increased Incidence of Hepatitis B Virus**

The market in North America, which was valued at USD 2.60 billion in 2021, is expected to dominate the global market throughout the projected period. The biggest market share for hepatitis B vaccines is held by the North America region, which has benefited from the increased prevalence of hepatitis B disease.

In terms of revenue and market share, Europe is the second-most dominant continent. Due to numerous regional action plans that European government authorities had put in place, the HBV market in Europe held a sizable share.

The market in Asia Pacific is primarily driven by the region’s increasing hepatitis B prevalence, with vaccine manufacturers concentrating on fund-raising and cross-industry partnerships for development.
