Brain health supplements are dietary supplements that are marketed to improve cognitive function. These supplements typically contain ingredients that are believed to boost brainpower, such as vitamins, minerals, herbs, and amino acids. The increased intake of high-sugar food, refined carbs, unhealthy fats, processed foods, and consumption of other unhealthy food leads the human body to release too much stress hormone, further activating microglia and astrocytes. Activation of these glial cells in the central nervous system (CNS) causes problems with the brain's cognitive functions and develops symptoms of impaired memory and learning.
