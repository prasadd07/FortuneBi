The [market for trauma implants](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/industry-reports/trauma-implants-market-101901) was valued at **USD 7.28 billion globally** in 2018 and is anticipated to grow to **USD 10.14 billion by 2026**, at a **CAGR of 4.3%**. Due to the increase in the number of degenerative joint diseases, Europe is likely to hold the second-largest market share after North America. The market growth in Europe is likely to be boosted by increasing product launches and an increase in the number of major players with a strong distribution network. Due to the rising prevalence of bone diseases, rising disposable incomes, expanding patient population, and gradually improving healthcare infrastructure, the Asia Pacific trauma implants market is anticipated to expand rapidly during the forecast period.

**Companies Increase Production of Screws to Support Spine Fusion Surgeries**

Trauma implants aid in reducing pain and easing joint movement. Companies in the global trauma implant market are expanding their production capacity for interlocking nails, plates, screws, and pins/wires. In addition to being used as an adjunct to spine fusion surgery to help hold implants in place, screws are used to immobilise fractured bone segments to speed up the healing process.

As it secures rods into the spine, a pedicle screw is a type of bone screw frequently used in spine fusion surgery. A short rod is then used to connect the screws after they have been inserted at two (or, in some cases, three) consecutive spine segments (for example, lumbar segments 4 and 5).

**Trauma Implants Market Drivers: Overview**

An increase in sports-related injuries is likely to add to the causes of bone fractures, which will significantly accelerate the growth of trauma implants over the forecast period.

Degenerative bone diseases, including Paget’s disease, osteoporosis, and osteoarthritis result in the deterioration of bones and cause extreme pain and stiffness in joints

Osteoarthritis is more common in people aged over 40, and the risk of the disease increases with age. According to the WHO, globally, the population of individuals aged 60 years and above was 900 million (12% of the total population) in 2015. The number is estimated to reach 2 billion (22% of the global population) by 2050. An increase in the geriatric population is projected to increase the incidence of degenerative bone diseases across the globe, thereby fueling the demand for trauma products.

An increase in the incidence of osteoporosis is a key factor boosting the growth of the global market. According to the National Osteoporosis Foundation, in 2018, an estimated 10 million people in the U.S. had osteoporosis and another 44 million had a low bone density, placing them at higher risk. An increase in the global geriatric population that is prone to low bone density is another major factor fueling the growth of the global market.

According to data published by the International Osteoporosis Foundation in 2020, globally, one in five men and one in three women aged over 50 could experience osteoporosis fractures in their remaining lifetimes
