The [market for veterinary diagnostics](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/industry-reports/veterinary-diagnostics-market-101040) was valued at **USD 4.4 billion in 2018** and is anticipated to grow to **USD 9.5 billion by 2026**, at a **CAGR of 10.0%**. An essential and crucial part of managing and preventing the spread of diseases among animals is veterinary diagnostics. The market for animal diagnostics is expanding quickly due to the increased focus on preventing and controlling zoonotic animal diseases that directly affect the global human population. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported in 2017 that approximately 10,000 Americans experience zoonotic diseases each year.

The demand for efficient veterinary diagnostics techniques is likely to be driven by the rising prevalence of veterinary diseases that affect both animals and humans as well as the rising costs of treating veterinary diseases. For instance, the American Veterinary Medicine Association (AVMA) survey conducted in 2016 found that 1 in 4 dogs in the U.S. are thought to develop neoplasia. Additionally, about 50.0% of dogs with neoplasia are at risk of developing cancer.

**Veterinary Diagnostics Market Drivers**

The rapid increase in pet ownership worldwide is largely due to rising disposable incomes and the spreading adoption of modern lifestyles. Additionally, the availability of cutting-edge methods for diagnosing diseases in animals and rising public awareness of the importance of animal health care are likely to fuel further growth in the global market for animal diagnosis products.

The American Pet Products Association (APPA) conducted the 2017–2018 National Pet Owners Survey, which estimates that 85 million American families and 68% of American households own pets. Additionally, according to Pet Supplies Plus, baby boomers are adopting pets in record numbers because of the companionship and emotional benefits that pets can provide. In the upcoming years, the demand for veterinary diagnostics products is likely to increase due to rising awareness about the use of companion animals in the treatment of a variety of health issues, including autism and post-traumatic stress disorder among the elderly population.

Point-of-care diagnostics are gradually replacing conventional veterinary diagnosis techniques in veterinary care in an effort to speed up diagnosis turnaround time and improve convenience for both pet owners and animals. Increasing product launches & partnerships by major players as well as growing technological advancements in the diagnosis of animal disease are likely to boost the growth of the veterinary diagnostics market over the forecast period. For instance, one of the major players in the veterinary diagnosis market, AniPOC Ltd., announced the start of its distribution partnership with Vet Direct Ltd. in May 2017.
