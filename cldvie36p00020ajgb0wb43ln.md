The [size of the global transrectal ultrasound market](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/industry-reports/transrectal-ultrasound-trus-market-100137) was estimated at **USD 204.8 million in 2017** and is expected to grow at a **CAGR of 4.5%** to reach **USD 291.2 million** by the end of 2025. The market is seeing the introduction of new and innovative systems due to market players operating in the ultrasound segment putting more emphasis on R&D. The global market for TRUS devices is expanding as a result of rising incidences of benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer, as well as rising government initiatives to encourage early detection of prostate cancer. By 2025, the transrectal ultrasound market is anticipated to generate **US$291.2 million.**

North America held a considerable share in the global TRUS market in 2017. High diagnostic rates of benign prostatic hyperplasia, rising prevalence of urological disorders, and robust healthcare infrastructure contributed towards the growth of this region. The demand for transrectal ultrasound procedures in Europe is also expected to rise steadily during the forecast period mainly on account of the rising geriatric population and demand for minimally invasive devices.

Among regions, Asia Pacific is likely to offer lucrative growth opportunities to enterprises operating in the global TRUS market. The huge installed bases of transrectal ultrasound or TRUS devices in the Asia Pacific is one of the major factors driving the TRUS market. A rising need to replace existing healthcare infrastructure in the Asia Pacific is another factor driving the TRUS market.

**Stringent Healthcare Policies by Regulatory Authorities may Inhibit Growth**

Despite witnessing strong growth prospects, there are certain factors that may restrict the market in the coming years. Strict regulations regarding approvals on healthcare medications and diagnoses may inhibit the growth of the market. In addition to this, product recalls due to safety issues may restrict the TRUS market to growth in the next coming years. Nonetheless, several companies are planning to invest in R&D activities and technological developments, which will propel growth in the TRUS market.

**Lifestyle Changes Leading to Rising Prevalence of Prostate Cancer in turn Fueling Demand for TRUS Devices** 

“The demand for effective treatment for urological abnormalities such as prostate cancer is increasing primarily due to rapid changes in lifestyle,” stated a lead analyst at Fortune Business Insights. “This is one of the chief factors driving the TRUS market,” he added. The transrectal ultrasound of the prostate helps to locate the position of cysts in the male reproductive system and identify if they are cancerous or non-cancerous.

This is the reason why the male population prefers transrectal ultrasound scan to any other normal tests. The healthcare infrastructure in developed and developing countries is sophisticated and well-equipped. This, coupled with better product availability, is boosting the TRUS market. There are several other factors spelling growth in the TRUS market. Governments across regions are actively participating to ensure the early detection and timely treatment of prostate cancer. This factor, combined with technological developments, is anticipated to bode well for the TRUS market.

Transrectal ultrasound or endorectal ultrasound uses different technologies to get accurate and precise test results. These technologies include 2D, and 3D technology, and others such as real-time imaging. The advent of such technologies is projected to further drive the TRUS market in the coming years. The adoption of TRUS devices is likely to increase in hospitals, clinics, diagnostic centres, and surgical centres. This will encourage companies to introduce novel TRUS devices with the help of upcoming technologies.
