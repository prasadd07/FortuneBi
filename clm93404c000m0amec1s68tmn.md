**Major Drivers**

Increasing prevalence of poultry diseases: Poultry diseases can cause significant losses to the poultry industry. Some of the most common poultry diseases include avian influenza, Newcastle disease, and infectious bronchitis. These diseases can spread rapidly and cause high mortality rates. The increasing prevalence of these diseases is driving the demand for poultry diagnostics.

Growing demand for poultry-derived food products: Poultry is a major source of protein for people around the world. The need for poultry-derived food products is growing due to the increasing population and rising disposable incomes. The growing demand for poultry products is also driving the demand for poultry diagnostics.

Increasing focus on food safety: Consumers are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of food safety. Poultry diseases can pose a serious threat to food safety. The increasing focus on food safety is driving the demand for poultry diagnostics.

**Segmentation**

The poultry diagnostics market is segmented by test type, service type, disease type, and region.

**By test type:** The market is segmented into serological tests, molecular tests, and microbiological tests. Serological tests are the most common type of poultry diagnostic test. These tests detect the presence of antibodies to poultry diseases. Molecular tests are the most sensitive type of poultry diagnostic test. These tests detect the presence of the genetic material of poultry diseases. Microbiological tests detect the presence of bacteria or viruses that cause poultry diseases.

**By service type:** The market is segmented into in-house testing and contract testing. In-house testing is the most common type of poultry diagnostic service. This is done by the poultry farms themselves. Contract testing is done by third-party laboratories.

**By disease type:** The market is segmented into avian influenza, Newcastle disease, infectious bronchitis, colibacillosis, mycoplasmosis, chicken anaemia, avian reovirus, and others. Avian influenza is the most serious poultry disease. It can cause high mortality rates and can spread rapidly. Newcastle disease is another serious poultry disease. It can cause respiratory problems and neurological disorders in poultry. Infectious bronchitis is a common poultry disease that can cause respiratory problems in poultry.
