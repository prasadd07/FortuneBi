The coronavirus crisis has caused immense damage to the world’s economy. We understand that this health emergency has negatively impacted various sectors across the globe. Rising support from governments and several companies can help in the fight against this highly infectious virus. There are some industries that are struggling and some are thriving. More or less, nearly every sector is estimated to be impacted by this pandemic.

We are perpetually working on our reports to help uplift businesses in this crucial time. Our expertise and experience can offer enormous benefits to help regain during this global pandemic.   
Moreover, liberal reimbursement policies and increasing government support for healthcare services in the region is likely to contribute to the Asia Pacific peritoneal dialysis market expansion. India and China are some of the fastest-growing economies in the world and are attracting a lot of investments.

Baxter (a leading player in the healthcare industry) is expanding its operations in China and India. This in response is likely to propel growth in the global peritoneal dialysis market. North America also held a significant share of the global market in 2017. However, the region may grow at a relatively slower CAGR during the forecast period. The growth witnessed is attributable to the smaller patient pool in the region compared to the Asia Pacific and other regions.

**Automated Peritoneal Dialysis Stood Out as the Most Preferred Treatment**

In terms of type, the continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) segment emerged dominant in the global market in 2017. The segment accounted for 53% of the global market in the given year. However, the automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) segment is anticipated to expand at a relatively higher CAGR. The growth witnessed is attributable to the increasing number of patients preferring to choose APD, backed by recent technological advancements in the segment. This is expected to fuel the demand for peritoneal dialysis solutions.

According to an article published by the National Centre for Biotechnology Information in 2015. In the U.S. among the patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis, 60% choose APD, and in Europe, only 50% of patients choose APD. The adoption of automated peritoneal dialysis is increasing and is likely to increase the growth rate in the global market.

**Baxter Expanding its Operations in India and China**

Baxter is leading the global market at present and is anticipated to dominate the global market during the forecast period as well. The growth witnessed is attributable to the company’s diverse product portfolio and strong brand presence across the globe. This is likely to increase the competition and propel growth in the market.
