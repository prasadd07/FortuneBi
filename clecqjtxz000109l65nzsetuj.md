The [global surgical robots market](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/industry-reports/surgical-robots-market-100948) will derive growth from recent technological advancements that have enabled minimally invasive surgeries. According to a report published by Fortune Business Insights, titled “Surgical Robots: Global Market Analysis, Insights and Forecast, 2019-2026,” the market was valued at **US$ 1,463.0 Mn** in 2018. Fortune Business Insights predicts that the market will reach **6,875.1 Mn by 2026**, thereby exhibiting a **CAGR of 21.4%** during the forecast period.

Surgical robots are used to perform computer-assisted surgeries in the presence and guidance of skilled surgeons. Surgical robots were manufactured to enable magnified images and efficient surgical operations within the intricate human anatomy. The ability of surgical robots to conduct precise hand movements without having to deal with shortcomings such as fatigue, instability, and distractions has enabled efficient surgical procedures within less time. This, in turn, has led to a rising uptake of surgical robots across the world.
