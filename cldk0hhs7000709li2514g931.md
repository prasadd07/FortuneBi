**Drivers and Restraints:**

**Growing Demand for Treatment Options Due to Soaring Prevalence of Astigmatism and Other Diseases**

The US reading glasses market growth is being powered by an increase in the number of major eye disorders. These include hyperopia, astigmatism, and presbyopia. Some of the other factors impelling the industry expansion comprise the soaring introduction of advanced eyeglasses, increasing prevalence of key eye disorders, and escalated screen time per day. 

However, the industry landscape is likely to be hindered by the surging demand for contact lenses and the provision of distinct advantages such as increased aesthetics and the elimination of discomfort.

**Key Points Covered in U.S. Reading Glasses Market**

* The growing demand for reading glasses among older adults is a key driver of the U.S. reading glasses market. As the population ages, the number of individuals with age-related vision impairments, such as presbyopia, is expected to increase.
    
* The availability of a wide variety of reading glasses styles, including traditional frames, bifocals, and progressive lenses, is also expected to support market growth.
    
* The increasing popularity of online sales channels is another key trend in the U.S. reading glasses market. Online retailers offer a wider selection of reading glasses and often at lower prices than brick-and-mortar stores.
    
* The rise of at-home vision testing and online prescription verification tools is also impacting the market. This technology allows consumers to purchase reading glasses without the need for an in-person eye exam.
    
* The emergence of new technologies, such as smart reading glasses that track eye movement and adjust focus, is expected to create new opportunities in the U.S. reading glasses market in the coming years.
    

**COVID-19 Impact:**

**Industry Growth Hindered Due to Difficulty in Accessing Optometric Services**

The COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected the industry with prominent participants registering a huge decline in revenue. This is mainly on account of the difficulty in accessing optometric services owing to the spread of the pandemic. This led to a drop in the product adoption rate, resulting in decreased demand for routine check-ups. These factors hindered the US reading glasses market share to some extent.

**Segments:**

**18-64 Years Segment to Gain Traction Due to Growing Incidences of Major Eye Disorders**

Of these, the 18-64 years segment accounted for a major share in 2021 and is set to record substantial growth over the estimated period. The rise can be attributed to the surging prevalence of critical eye disorders.

**+0.25 to +2 Segment to Emerge Prominent Owing to Surging Product Demand**

On the basis of corrective strength, the US reading glasses market is fragmented into +0.25 to +2, +2.25 to +3, and greater than +3. The +0.25 to +2 segment captured a key share in 2021 and is expected to record lucrative expansion over the analysis period. The rise is being driven by the escalating U.S. population in the age group of 4-59 years and the mounting demand for glasses with corrective strength.
