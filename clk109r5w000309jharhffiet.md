**Surgical Robots Market Size, Share and Industry Analysis By Application (General Surgery, Gynecology, Urology, Orthopedics, Others), By End User (Hospitals, Ambulatory Surgery Centers, Others) and Regional Forecast To 2026**

The global surgical robot market is growing at a CAGR of 21.4%, driven by the increasing demand for minimally invasive surgery, the rising prevalence of chronic diseases, and the technological advancements in surgical robots. Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is a surgical procedure that is performed through small incisions, as opposed to traditional open surgery, which requires larger incisions. MIS is associated with a number of benefits, including shorter recovery times, less pain, and a lower risk of infection.

According To Research Done By Fortune Business Insights, The Global surgical robots market size is projected to reach USD 6,875.1 million by 2026, exhibiting a CAGR of 21.4% between 2018 and 2026. The rising prevalence of chronic diseases, such as cancer, heart disease, and obesity, is also driving the growth of the surgical robot market. These diseases often require surgery, and surgical robots can help to improve the accuracy and precision of these procedures.
