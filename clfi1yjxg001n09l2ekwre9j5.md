In the US, the population over the age of 65 is expected to reach 95 million by 2060, as per Population Reference Bureau in America. These demographic trends are anticipated to considerably enhance the potential of the market during the forecast period.

**Europe to Hold Leading Position; North America to Showcase High CAGR**

With a revenue of generation of 1.08 billion in 2018, Europe is projected to dominate the global Urinary Catheter Market share till 2026. This is mainly because of the high incidence of urinary disorders among the geriatric population in the region. Advancements in treating urological diseases will be the major factor driving the market in North America.
