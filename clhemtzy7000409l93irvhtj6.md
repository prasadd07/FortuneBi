Advances in technology have paved the way for many innovations in healthcare, including the development of [drug delivery systems](https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/drug-delivery-systems-market-103070). These systems provide a way to administer drugs to patients in a targeted and efficient manner, reducing side effects and improving treatment outcomes. As a result, the drug delivery market has been growing rapidly, with many new players entering the field and existing players expanding their offerings.

The global drug delivery market is expected to reach USD 71.75 billion by 2029, according to a report by Fortune Business Insights. This growth is driven by several factors, including an ageing population, rising prevalence of chronic diseases, and increasing demand for self-administration of drugs. The development of novel drug delivery technologies and the availability of funding for research and development has also contributed to the market's growth.

The drug delivery market is comprised of several segments, including oral drug delivery, injectable drug delivery, transdermal drug delivery, inhalation drug delivery, and others. Each segment has its own unique challenges and opportunities.

Oral drug delivery is the most common route of drug administration, accounting for over 60% of the market share. This segment includes tablets, capsules, and liquids, among other forms. One of the major challenges in this segment is ensuring the drug is absorbed properly and effectively. To address this, companies are developing novel formulations and delivery technologies that can enhance drug absorption.

Injectable drug delivery is the second-largest segment, accounting for over 25% of the market share. This segment includes intravenous, intramuscular, and subcutaneous injections, among others. Injectable drug delivery is preferred for drugs that cannot be administered orally or are not effective when taken orally. The development of new biologic drugs has also contributed to the growth of this segment.

Transdermal drug delivery is a growing segment that involves the delivery of drugs through the skin. This segment includes patches, gels, and creams, among others. Transdermal drug delivery is preferred for drugs that require continuous delivery or are sensitive to stomach acid. The growing popularity of wearable devices has also contributed to the growth of this segment.

Inhalation drug delivery is a segment that involves the delivery of drugs through the respiratory system. This segment includes inhalers, nebulizers, and other devices. Inhalation drug delivery is preferred for drugs that need to be delivered directly to the lungs or respiratory tract, such as those used to treat asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

The drug delivery market is highly competitive, with many players vying for market share. Some of the leading companies in the market include Johnson & Johnson, Novartis AG, Roche, Pfizer Inc., and Merck & Co., Inc. These companies are investing heavily in research and development to develop new drug delivery technologies and formulations.
