## **LASIK Eye Surgery Market Size, Share and COVID-19 Impact Analysis, By Procedure Type (Traditional LASIK, Custom LASIK, and Bladeless LASIK), By End User (Hospitals, Eye care clinics, and LASIK centres), By Technology (Excimer Lasers and Femtosecond Lasers) and Regional Forecast, 2023-2030  
**

LASIK eye surgery is a laser-based procedure that corrects vision problems such as nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism. The surgery is performed by reshaping the cornea, the clear front part of the eye.

Factors driving market expansion include the increasing prevalence of refractive errors worldwide, rising awareness of the benefits of LASIK, and advancements in laser technology and surgical techniques.

## **Segmentation**

### **The LASIK eye surgery market is segmented by type, procedure, and region.**

The type segment is further segmented into LASIK, PRK, and SMILE. LASIK is the most common type of LASIK surgery, and it is performed by creating a flap in the cornea and then using a laser to reshape the underlying tissue. PRK is a less invasive type of LASIK surgery, and it is performed by removing a thin layer of the cornea and then using a laser to reshape the underlying tissue. SMILE is a newer type of LASIK surgery, and it is performed by using a femtosecond laser to create a small incision in the cornea and then using a microkeratome to remove a small amount of tissue from the cornea.

The procedure segment is further segmented into refractive surgery and cataract surgery. Refractive surgery is performed to correct vision problems, and cataract surgery is performed to remove a cloudy lens in the eye.

The region segment is further segmented into North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America. North America is the largest market for LASIK eye surgery, due to the high prevalence of refractive errors and the early adoption of new technologies.

## **Key Players**

The key players in the LASIK eye surgery market include Alcon, Abbott Medical Optics, Johnson & Johnson Vision, Bausch & Lomb, and WaveLight. These companies are investing in research and development to develop new and innovative LASIK surgery technologies.

### **Trends**

### **The LASIK eye surgery market is expected to continue to grow in the coming years, driven by the following trends:**

* Increasing prevalence of refractive errors: The global prevalence of refractive errors is estimated to be around 2.5 billion people. This number is expected to increase in the coming years, due to the ageing population and the rising prevalence of lifestyle diseases such as diabetes.
    
* Rising demand for minimally invasive procedures: LASIK eye surgery is a minimally invasive procedure, and it is often preferred over other types of vision correction surgery, such as cataract surgery.
    
* Technological advancements: There have been significant technological advancements in LASIK surgery in recent years. These advancements have made LASIK surgery more precise and safer.
    

## **Conclusion**

The LASIK eye surgery market is a growing market, and it is expected to continue to grow in the coming years. The market is being driven by the increasing prevalence of refractive errors, the rising demand for minimally invasive procedures, and the technological advancements in LASIK surgery.
