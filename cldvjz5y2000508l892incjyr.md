**North America to Lead Global Market with Rising Prevalence of Rheumatoid Arthritis**

The North American market was worth US$ 9,929.6 Mn in 2017. It is expected to show a steady rise owing to the rising prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis and increasing awareness about this disorder. Adding to that, governments of North America are investing huge sums in improving the healthcare and medical facilities in the region. This is helping the rheumatoid arthritis therapeutics market to grow at an impressive pace in North America.

On the other side, the demand for rheumatoid arthritis treatment is likely to grow at a considerable pace in the Asia Pacific. This is owing to the entry of new drugs, especially biologics, for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in the market. This, coupled with the expansion of healthcare and medical infrastructure in emerging nations, is likely to help the rheumatoid arthritis therapeutic market in the Asia Pacific gain more momentum.

In terms of product type, the biologics segment is anticipated to hold the highest share in the market in terms of revenue during the forecast period. In 2017, the biologics segment held 87.6% of the rheumatoid arthritis therapeutics market.
