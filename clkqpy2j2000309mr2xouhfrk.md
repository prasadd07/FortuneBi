## Diabetes Treatment Devices Market Size, Share & Industry Analysis, By Product (Insulin Pens, Insulin Pumps, Insulin Jet Injectors, Insulin Syringes, Others), By Distribution Channel (Institutional Sales, Retail Sales) and Regional Forecast To 2026  

Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects how the body turns food into energy. There are two main types of diabetes: type 1 and type 2. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that causes the body to attack its insulin-producing cells. Type 2 diabetes is caused by a combination of genetics and lifestyle factors, such as obesity and physical inactivity.

Diabetes treatment devices are used to help people with diabetes manage their blood sugar levels. These devices include insulin pumps, continuous glucose monitors (CGMs), and blood glucose meters. According to recent research done by Fortune Business Insights, The global diabetes treatment devices market size is projected to reach USD 16.49 billion by 2026, exhibiting a CAGR of 5.4% during the forecast period.
