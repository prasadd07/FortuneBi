**Trends**

The antimicrobial-coated CVC market is expected to continue to grow in the coming years, driven by the following trends:

* Increasing prevalence of HAIs: HAIs are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitals, and they are estimated to cost the US healthcare system billions of dollars each year. Antimicrobial-coated CVCs can help to reduce the risk of HAIs by preventing the growth of bacteria on the catheter surface.
    
* Rising demand for long-term vascular access: The demand for long-term vascular access is growing, due to the increasing number of patients who require long-term treatment with fluids, medications, and blood products. Antimicrobial-coated CVCs can help to reduce the risk of infection in patients who require long-term vascular access.
    
* Technological advancements: There have been significant technological advancements in antimicrobial coating technologies in recent years. These advancements have made it possible to develop more effective and durable antimicrobial coatings.
    

**Segmentation**
